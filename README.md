![Description](https://github.com/Modern-Modpacks/assets/blob/main/Curseforge/PO/description.png?raw=true)

Powah: Overcharged is a maintained fork of Powah for 1.16. We created this because there were some features lacking from the original Powah that we didn't like. So, we forked it and started working.

![Features](https://github.com/Modern-Modpacks/assets/blob/main/Curseforge/PO/features.png?raw=true)

    Energy Production
    Energy Transportation
    QOL for pack-makers
    Intensive Guidebook
    and more!
