![Description](https://github.com/Modern-Modpacks/assets/blob/main/Curseforge/PO/description.png?raw=true)

Powah: Overcharged is a maintained fork of Powah for 1.16. We created this because there were some features lacking from the original Powah that we didn't like. So, we forked it and started working.

What makes this different from the original powah?

    Built in KubeJS integration
    Extra tier (Overcharged)
    Custom armor using materials in Powah

![Features](https://github.com/Modern-Modpacks/assets/blob/main/Curseforge/PO/features.png?raw=true)

    Energy Transportation
    QOL for pack-makers
    Intensive Guidebook
    and more!
